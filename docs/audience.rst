Target audience

Who is the target audience of the radiometry package? Is it interesting for me?


Synchrotron radiometry people at PTB Berlin
===========================================

The radiometry package currently primarily addresses **radiometry** people working at the synchrotron beamlines at BESSY-II and MLS in Berlin operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_. If you are looking for a **data viewer tool**, aimed at conveniently inspecting data directly at the beamline, you may have a look at the ``evedataviewer`` package.


Motivation and general ideas
============================

The motivation and general idea behind the radiometry package is to ensure reproducibility and---as much as possible---replicability of data processing, starting from recording data and ending with their final (graphical) representation, e.g., in a peer-reviewed publication. This is achieved by relying on the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_ taking care of mostly automatically creating a gap-less record of each processing step.

Every scientist should be well familiar with the concept of reproducibility and its importance for science in general. If you don't really care about reproducibility, you will probably have hard time using the radiometry package in the way it is developed for. If, however, you do care about reproducibility and are looking for a system that helps you to achieve this goal, the radiometry package may well be interesting for you.
