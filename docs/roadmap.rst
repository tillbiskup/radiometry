Roadmap

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* Dataset structure for general :class:`radiometry.dataset.EveDataset`

  * Idea: Get access to all information possibly contained in the eve HDF5 files, so that eve users know better what would be available to them. Ideally, this will positively influence further eve development.

  * As a next step after the dataset structure has been created, the eveviewer GUI needs to be able to display all this information in a somewhat sensible way.

* Importer for eve HDF5 files

* Minimum functionality required for eveviewer

  * dataset
  * importer
  * plotter
